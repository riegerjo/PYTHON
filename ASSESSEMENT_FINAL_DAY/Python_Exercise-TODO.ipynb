       "'Milan (, also US: , Milanese: [miˈlãː]; Italian: Milano [miˈlaːno] (listen)) is a city in northern Italy, capital of Lombardy, and the second-most populous city in Italy after Rome, with the city proper having a population of 1,395,274 while its metropolitan city has a population of 3,257,535. Its continuously built-up urban area (that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Milan) has a population estimated to be about 5,270,000 over 1,891 square kilometres (730 square miles). The wider Milan metropolitan area, known as Greater Milan, is a polycentric metropolitan region that extends over central Lombardy and eastern Piedmont and which counts an estimated total population of 7.5 million, making it by far the largest metropolitan area in Italy and the 54th largest in the world. Milan served as capital of the Western Roman Empire from 286 to 402 and the Duchy of Milan during the medieval period and early modern age.\\nMilan is considered a leading alpha global city, with strengths in the field of the art, commerce, design, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, services, research and tourism. Its business district hosts Italy\\'s stock exchange (Italian: Borsa Italiana), and the headquarters of national and international banks and companies. In terms of GDP, it has the third-largest economy among European cities after Paris and London, but the fastest in growth among the three, and is the wealthiest among European non-capital cities. Milan is considered part of the Blue Banana and one of the \"Four Motors for Europe\".\\nThe city has been recognized as one of the world\\'s four fashion capitals thanks to several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are currently among the world\\'s biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. It hosted the Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. The city hosts numerous cultural institutions, academies and universities, with 11% of the national total enrolled students. Milan is the destination of 8 million overseas visitors every year, attracted by its museums and art galleries that include some of the most important collections in the world, including major works by Leonardo da Vinci. The city is served by many luxury hotels and is the fifth-most starred in the world by Michelin Guide. The city is home to two of Europe\\'s most successful football teams, A.C. Milan and F.C. Internazionale, and one of Italy\\'s main basketball teams, Olimpia Milano. Milan, along with the ski resort of Cortina d\\'Ampezzo, will host the 2026 Winter Olympics.\\n\\n\\n== Toponymy ==\\n\\nThe etymology of the name Milan (Lombard: Milan [miˈlãː]) remains uncertain. One theory holds that the Latin name Mediolanum comes from the Latin words medio (in the middle) and planus (plain). However, some scholars believe that lanum comes from the Celtic root lan, meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word llan, meaning \"a sanctuary or church\", ultimately cognate to English/German Land) in which Celtic communities used to build shrines. Hence Mediolanum could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in France bore the name \"Mediolanum\", for example: Saintes (Mediolanum Santonum) and Évreux (Mediolanum Aulercorum). In addition, another theory links the name to the boar sow (the Scrofa semilanuta) an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in Andrea Alciato\\'s Emblemata (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of Mediolanum given as \"half-wool\", explained in Latin and in French.\\nThe foundation of Milan is credited to two Celtic peoples, the Bituriges and the Aedui, having as their emblems a ram and a boar; therefore \"The city\\'s symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool.\" Alciato credits Ambrose for his account.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prehistory and Roman times ===\\n\\nThe Celtic Insubres, the inhabitants of the region of northern Italy called Insubria, appear to have founded Milan around 600 BC. According to the legend reported by Livy (writing between 27 and 9 BC), the Gaulish king Ambicatus sent his nephew Bellovesus into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; this Bellovesus allegedly founded Mediolanum in the time of Tarquinius Priscus, who traditionally reigned from 616 to 579 BC, according to this legend.\\nThe Romans, led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, fought the Insubres and captured the city in 222 BC; the chief of the Insubres submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the city. They eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new  province \"Cisalpine Gaul\" (Latin: Gallia Cisalpina) – \"Gaul this side of the Alps\" – and may have given the site its  Latinized Celtic name of Mediolanum: in Gaulish *medio- meant \"middle, center\" and the name element -lanon is the Celtic equivalent of Latin -planum \"plain\", thus *Mediolanon (Latinized as Mediolānum) meant \"(settlement) in the midst of the plain\".In 286 the Roman Emperor Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum.Diocletian himself chose to reside at Nicomedia in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague Maximian at Milan. Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large circus (470 × 85 metres), the thermae or \"Baths of Hercules\", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area surrounded by a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5 km long) encompassing an area of 375 acres with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; one included in the convent of  San Maurizio Maggiore remains 16.6 m high.\\nFrom Mediolanum the Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, and thus paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion of Roman Europe. Constantine had come to Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, Licinius. In 402 the Visigoths besieged the city and the Emperor Honorius moved the Imperial residence to Ravenna.\\nIn 452 Attila in his turn besieged Mediolanum, but the real break with the city\\'s Imperial past came in 539, during the  Gothic War, when  Uraia (a nephew of Witiges, formerly King of the  Italian Ostrogoths), laid Mediolanum to waste with great loss of life.\\nThe Lombards took Ticinum as their capital in 572 (renaming it Papia – the modern Pavia), and left early-medieval Milan to the governance of its  archbishops.\\n\\n\\n=== Middle Ages ===\\n\\nAfter the city was besieged by the Visigoths in 402, the imperial residence was moved to Ravenna. An age of decline began which worsened when Attila, King of the Huns, sacked and devastated the city in 452 AD. In 539, the Ostrogoths conquered and destroyed Milan during the Gothic War against Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. In the summer of 569 the Lombards (from which the name of the Italian region Lombardy derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small Byzantine garrison left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule. Milan surrendered to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774.\\n\\nThe 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the German emperors. The city-state was born, an expression of the new political power of the city and its will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers. The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help. This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the Peace of Constance in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the Ambrosian Republic was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city. Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. Nonetheless, the Republic collapsed when, in 1450, Milan was conquered by Francesco I of the House of Sforza, which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian Renaissance.\\n\\n\\n=== Early modern ===\\n\\nMilan\\'s last independent ruler, Lodovico il Moro, called French king Charles VIII into Italy in the expectation that France might be an ally against other Italian statelets. The future king of France, Louis of Orléans, took part in the expedition and realised Italy was virtually defenceless. This prompted him to come back a few years later in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling Visconti family. At that time, Milan was also defended by Swiss mercenaries. After the victory of Louis\\'s successor François I over the Swiss at the Battle of Marignan, the duchy was promised to the French king François I. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor Charles V defeated François I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, northern Italy, including Milan, passed to Habsburg Spain.In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son Philip II and his brother Ferdinand I. Charles\\'s Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand\\'s Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire.\\nThe Great Plague of Milan in 1629–31 killed an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000. This episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of plague that began with the Black Death.In 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of Charles II. After his death, the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French Philippe of Anjou to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in Ramillies and Turin and were forced to yield northern Italy to the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1713–1714 the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain\\'s Italian possessions including Lombardy and its capital, Milan.\\n\\n\\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\\n\\nOn 18 March 1848, the Milanese rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"Five Days\" (Italian: Le Cinque Giornate), and Field Marshal Radetzky was forced to withdraw from the city temporarily. The Kingdom of Sardinia stepped in to help the insurgents; a plebiscite held in Lombardy decided in favour of unification with Sardinia. However, after defeating the Sardinian forces at Custoza on 24 July, Radetzky was able to reassert Austrian control over Milan and northern Italy. A few years on, however, Italian nationalists again called for the removal of Austria and Italian unification. Sardinia and France formed an alliance and defeated Austria at the Battle of Solferino in 1859. Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia, which soon gained control of most of Italy and in 1861 was rechristened as the Kingdom of Italy.\\nThe political unification of Italy cemented Milan\\'s commercial dominance over northern Italy. It also led to a flurry of railway construction that had started under Austrian patronage (Venice–Milan; Milan–Monza) that made Milan the rail hub of northern Italy. Thereafter with the opening of the Gotthard (1881) and Simplon (1906) railway tunnels, Milan became the major South European rail focus for business and passenger movements e.g. the Simplon Orient Express. Rapid industrialization and market expansion put Milan at the centre of Italy\\'s leading industrial region, including extensive stone quarries that have led to much of the air pollution we see today in the region. In the 1890s Milan was shaken by the Bava-Beccaris massacre, a riot related to a high inflation rate. Meanwhile, as Milanese banks dominated Italy\\'s financial sphere, the city became the country\\'s leading financial centre.\\nIn 1919, Benito Mussolini\\'s Blackshirts rallied for the first time in Piazza San Sepolcro and later began their March on Rome in Milan. During the Second World War Milan suffered extensive damage from Allied bombings. When Italy surrendered in 1943, German forces occupied most of Northern Italy until 1945. As a result, resistance groups formed. As the war came to an end, the American 1st Armored Division advanced on Milan—but before they arrived, the resistance seized control of the city and executed Mussolini along with several members of his government. On 29 April 1945, the corpses of Mussolini, his mistress Clara Petacci and other Fascist leaders were hanged in Piazzale Loreto.\\nDuring the post-war economic boom, a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of Southern Italy) moved to Milan. The population grew from 1.3 million in 1951 to 1.7 million in 1967. During this period, Milan was largely reconstructed, with the building of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower. The economic prosperity was, however, overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called Years of Lead, when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence, labour strikes and political terrorism. The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when a bomb exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing seventeen people and injuring eighty-eight.\\nIn the 1980s, with the international success of Milanese houses (like Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana), Milan became one of the world\\'s fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in international tourism, notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalisation more than five-fold. This period led the mass media to nickname the metropolis \"Milano da bere\", literally \"Milan to drink\". However, in the 1990s, Milan was badly affected by Tangentopoli, a political scandal in which many politicians and businessmen were tried for corruption. The city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles, automobile and steel production.In the early 21st century, Milan underwent a series of sweeping redevelopments. Its exhibition centre moved to a much larger site in Rho. New business districts such as Porta Nuova and CityLife were constructed. With the decline in manufacturing, the city has sought to develop on its other sources of revenue, including publishing, finance, banking, fashion design, information technology, logistics, transport and tourism. In addition, the city\\'s decades-long population decline seems to have come to an end in recent years, with signs of recovery as it grew by seven percent since the last census.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nMilan is located in the north-western section of the Po Valley, approximately halfway between the river Po to the south and the foothills of the Alps with the great lakes (Lake Como, Lake Maggiore, Lake Lugano) to the north, the Ticino river to the west and the Adda to the east. The city\\'s land is flat, the highest point being at 122 m (400.26 ft) above sea level.\\nThe administrative commune covers an area of about 181 square kilometres (70 sq mi), with a population, in 2013, of 1,324,169 and a population density of 7,315 inhabitants per square kilometre (18,950/sq mi). The Metropolitan City of Milan covers 1,575 square kilometres (608 sq mi) and in 2015 had a population estimated at 3,196,825, with a resulting density of 2,029 inhabitants per square kilometre (5,260/sq mi). A larger urban area, comprising parts of the provinces of Milan, Monza e Brianza, Como, Lecco and Varese is 1,891 square kilometres (730 sq mi) wide and has a population of 5,270,000 with a density of 2,783 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,210/sq mi).The concentric layout of the city centre reflects the Navigli, an ancient system of navigable and interconnected canals, now mostly covered. The suburbs of the city have expanded mainly to the north, swallowing up many communes to reach Varese, Como, Lecco and Bergamo.\\n\\n\\n== Climate ==\\n\\nMilan has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to the Köppen climate classification. Milan\\'s climate is similar to much of Northern Italy\\'s inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The Alps and Apennine Mountains form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea.During winter, daily average temperatures can fall below freezing (0 °C [32 °F]) and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan\\'s area is 25 centimetres (10 in) in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of 90 centimetres (35 in) in January 1985. In the suburbs the average can reach 36 centimetres (14 in). The city receives on average seven days of snow per year.The city is often shrouded in heavy fog, although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighbourhoods and the urban heat island effect have reduced this occurrence in recent decades. Occasionally, the Foehn winds cause the temperatures to rise unexpectedly: on 22 January 2012 the daily high reached 16 °C (61 °F) while on 22 February 2012 it reached 21 °C (70 °F). Air pollution levels rise significantly in wintertime when cold air clings to the soil, causing Milan to be one of Europe\\'s most polluted cities.\\nIn summer, humidity levels are high and peak temperatures can reach temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F). Usually this season enjoys clearer skies with an average of more than 13 hours of daylight: when precipitations occur though, there is a higher likelihood of them being thunderstorms and hailstorms. Springs and autumns are generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F); these seasons are characterized by higher rainfall, especially in April and May. Relative humidity typically ranges between 45% (comfortable) and 95% (very humid) throughout the year, rarely dropping below 27% (dry) and reaching as high as 100% Wind is generally absent: over the course of the year typical wind speeds vary from 0 to 14 km/h (0 to 9 mph) (calm to gentle breeze), rarely exceeding 29 km/h (18 mph) (fresh breeze), except during summer thunderstorms when winds can blow strong. In the spring, gale-force windstorms may happen, generated either by Tramontane blowing from the Alps or by Bora-like winds from the north. \\n\\n\\n== Government ==\\n\\n\\n=== Municipal government ===\\n\\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which in cities with more than one million population is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (Giunta Comunale), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Milan is Giuseppe Sala, a left-wing independent leading a progressive alliance composed by Democratic Party and Italian Left.\\nThe municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils (Consigli di Municipio), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform. Each Borough Council is governed by a Council (Consiglio) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration (Testo Unico degli Enti Locali). After the 2016 administrative reform, the Borough Councils have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection, roads, parks, libraries and local commerce; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities.\\n\\n\\n=== Metropolitan city and regional government ===\\n\\nMilan is the capital of the eponymous Metropolitan city and of Lombardy, one of the twenty regions of Italy. While the Metropolitan city of Milan has a population of 3,277,524, making it the second-most populated metropolitan city of Italy after Rome, Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. The seat of the regional government is Palazzo Lombardia that, standing at 161.3 metres (529 feet), is the fifth-tallest building in Milan.\\nAccording to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Milan is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (città metropolitane), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (Sindaco metropolitano), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 24 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality. \\nMilan is divided into 9 boroughs.\\nThe Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since 21 June 2016 Giuseppe Sala, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.\\n\\n\\n== Cityscape ==\\n\\n\\n=== Skyline ===\\n\\nThere are two main areas which dominate Milan\\'s skyline: the Porta Nuova area in the north-east (boroughs n° 9 and 2) and the CityLife area (borough n° 8). The tallest buildings include the Unicredit Tower at 231 m (though only 162 m without the tower), and the 209 m Allianz Tower, which has 50 floors.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nThere are only few remains of the ancient Roman colony, notably the well-preserved Colonne di San Lorenzo. During the second half of the 4th century, Saint Ambrose, as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: Sant\\'Ambrogio, San Nazaro in Brolo, San Simpliciano and Sant\\'Eustorgio, which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. Milan\\'s Cathedral, built between 1386 and 1577, is the fifth-largest cathedral in the world and the most important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The gilt bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, placed in 1774 on the highest pinnacle of the Duomo, soon became one of the most enduring symbols of Milan.In the 15th century, when the Sforza ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the Castello Sforzesco, the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the Florentine Filarete, who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio. The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence\\'s Cosimo de\\' Medici bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the Ospedale Maggiore and Bramante\\'s work in the city, which includes Santa Maria presso San Satiro (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie and three cloisters for Sant\\'Ambrogio. The Counter-Reformation in the 16th to 17th centuries was also the period of Spanish domination and was marked by two powerful figures: Saint Charles Borromeo and his cousin, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, in a building designed by Francesco Maria Ricchino, and the nearby Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, Pellegrino Tibaldi, Galeazzo Alessi and Ricchino himself.Empress Maria Theresa of Austria was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. This urban and artistic renewal included the establishment of Teatro alla Scala, inaugurated in 1778, and the renovation of the Royal Palace. The late 1700s Palazzo Belgioioso by Giuseppe Piermarini and Royal Villa of Milan by Leopoldo Pollack, later the official residence of Austrian viceroys, are often regarded among the best examples of Neoclassical architecture in Lombardy. The Napoleonic rule of the city in 1805–1814, having established Milan as the capital of a satellite Kingdom of Italy, took steps in order to reshape it accordingly to its new status, with the construction of large boulevards, new squares (Porta Ticinese by Luigi Cagnola and Foro Bonaparte by Giovanni Antonio Antolini) and cultural institutions (Art Gallery and the Academy of Fine Arts). The massive Arch of Peace, situated at the bottom of Corso Sempione, is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the Second Industrial Revolution. The great Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, realised by Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate Vittorio Emanuele II, is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the Burlington Arcade in London. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the Cimitero Monumentale graveyard, built in a Neo-Romanesque style between 1863 and 1866.\\nThe tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture. Art Nouveau, also known as Liberty in Italy, is recognisable in Palazzo Castiglioni, built by architect Giuseppe Sommaruga between 1901 and 1903. Other examples include Hotel Corso, Casa Guazzoni with its wrought iron and staircase, and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city. A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past. An important example of Art Deco, which blended such styles with Fascist architecture, is the huge Central railway station inaugurated in 1931.The post–World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city\\'s architectural history, including Gio Ponti\\'s Pirelli Tower (1956–60), Velasca Tower (1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably Porta Nuova in downtown Milan and FieraMilano in the suburb of Rho. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the Citylife regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the 202-metre (663-foot) Isozaki Arata—when completed, the tallest building in Italy, the twisted Hadid Tower, and the curved Libeskind Tower.\\n\\n\\n=== Parks and gardens ===\\n\\nThe largest parks in the central area of Milan are Sempione Park, at the north-western edge, and Montanelli Gardens, situated northeast of the city. English-style Sempione Park, built in 1890, contains a Napoleonic Arena, the Milan City Aquarium, a steel lattice panoramic tower, an art exhibition centre, a Japanese garden and a public library. The Montanelli gardens, created in the 18th century, hosts the Natural History Museum of Milan and a planetarium. Slightly away from the city centre, heading east, Forlanini Park is characterised by a large pond and a few preserved shacks which remind of the area\\'s agricultural past.In addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it\\'s surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. Since 1990, the farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano) and south (Parco Agricolo Sud Milano) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks. West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\nWith rapid industrialisation in post-war years, the population of Milan peaked at 1,743,427 in 1973. Thereafter, during the following thirty years, almost one third of the population moved to the outer belt of new suburbs and satellite settlements that grew around the city proper. There were an estimated 1,368,590 official residents in the municipality of Milan at the end of 2016 and 3,218,201 in its province-level municipality. However, Milan\\'s urban area extends well beyond the limits of its administrative comune and was home to 5,270,000 people in 2015, while its wider, polycentric metropolitan area is estimated to have a population exceeding 8 million.\\n\\n\\n=== Foreign residents ===\\nAs of 2016, some 260,421 foreign residents lived in the municipality of Milan, representing 19% of the total resident population. These figures suggest that the immigrant population has more than doubled in the last 15 years. After World War II, Milan experienced two main waves of immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of migrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterised by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.\\nThe early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and overpopulated Southern Italy. In the last three decades, the foreign born share of the population soared. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular Eritrean, Egyptian, Moroccans, Senegalese, and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (notably Albania, Romania, Ukraine, Macedonia, Moldova, and Russia), in addition to a growing number of Asians (in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and Latin Americans (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total).Decades of continuing high immigration have made the city the most cosmopolitan and multicultural in Italy. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest Chinese community in Italy, with almost 21,000 people in 2011. Situated in the 9th district, and centred on Via Paolo Sarpi, an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from Wencheng County, in the Zhejiang province, and used to operate small textile and leather workshops. Milan has also a substantial English-speaking community (more than 3,000 American, British and Australian expatriates), and several English schools and language publications, such as Hello Milano, Where Milano and Easy Milano.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\nMilan\\'s population, like that of Italy as a whole, is mostly Catholic. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan. The city is also home to sizeable Orthodox, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, and Protestant communities.Milan has its own historic Catholic rite known as the Ambrosian Rite (Italian: Rito ambrosiano). It varies slightly from the typical Catholic rite (the Roman, used in all other western regions), with some differences in the liturgy and mass celebrations, in the Canons are Easter and Lent, in the colour of liturgical vestments, peculiar use of incense, marriage form, office for the dead, baptism by immersion, and in the calendar (for example, the date for the beginning of lent is celebrated some days after the common date, so the carnival has different date). The season of Advent is of six weeks duration and starts on the Sunday after the feast of Saint Martin (11 November). The Ambrosian rite is also practised in other surrounding locations in Lombardy, parts of Piedmont and in the Swiss canton of Ticino. The sounding of church bells uses a peculiar technique. Another important difference concerns the liturgical music. The Gregorian chant was completely unused in Milan and surrounding areas, because the official one was its own Ambrosian chant, definitively established by the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and earlier than the Gregorian. To preserve this music there has developed the unique schola cantorum, a college, and an Institute called PIAMS (Pontifical Ambrosian Institute of Sacred Music), in partnership with the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music (PIMS) in Rome.The Milan Synagogue was designed by Luca Beltrami in 1892. The Anglican Episcopal Church of All Saints Milan was built in 1896. In 1998 the construction of the Mosque of Segrate was completed. This was the first mosque with a dome and minaret in Italy since the destruction of the last mosques of Lucera in 1300. In 2014 the City Council agreed on the construction of another mosque next to the area of the former sport venue Palatrussardi.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nWhile Rome is Italy\\'s political capital, Milan is the country\\'s industrial and financial heart. With a 2014 GDP estimated at €158.9 billion, the province of Milan generates approximately 10% of the national GDP; while the economy of the Lombardy region generates approximately 22% of Italy\\'s GDP (or an estimated €357 billion in 2015, roughly the size of Belgium). The province of Milan is home to about 45% of businesses in the Lombardy region and more than 8 percent of all businesses in Italy, including three Fortune 500 companies. Milan also contains Via Monte Napoleone (Monte Napoleone Street), Europe\\'s most expensive street.Milan is close to the top 20% of the 327 OECD metropolitan areas with highest GDP per capita. In terms of PM 2.5 levels Milan is among the 10% most polluted OECD metropolitan areas. Milan is, since the late 1800s, an important industrial and manufacturing center, especially for the automotive industry, with companies such as Alfa Romeo, Pirelli and Techint having a significant presence in the city. Other important products manufactured in Milan include machinery, pharmaceuticals and plastics, health, chemicals and biotechnologies, food & beverage.\\nThe city is home to many media and advertising agencies, national newspapers and telecommunication companies, including both the public service broadcaster RAI and private television companies like Mediaset, La7 and Sky Italia. The city hosts the headquarters of the largest Italian publishing companies, such as Feltrinelli, Mondadori, RCS Media Group, Messaggerie Italiane, and Giunti Editore. Milan has also seen a rapid increase in internet companies with both domestic and international companies such as Altavista, Google, Lycos, Virgilio and Yahoo! establishing their Italian operations in the city.\\nAs Italy\\'s financial hub numerous headquarters of insurance companies as (Alleanza Assicurazioni, Vittoria Assicurazioni) as well as many banking groups (198 companies), including Banca Popolare di Milano, Mediobanca, Banca Mediolanum and UniCredit and over forty foreign banks are located in the city. Also, most asset management companies are based in Milan, including Azimut Holding, ARCA SGR, and Eurizon Capital. The Associazione Bancaria Italiana representing the Italian banking system and Milan Stock Exchange (225 companies listed on the stock exchange) are both located in the city.\\nMilan is a major world fashion centre, where the sector can count on 12,000 companies, 800 show rooms, and 6,000 sales outlets (with brands such as Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino and Luxottica), while four weeks a year are dedicated to top shows and other fashion events. The city is also a global hub for trade and design. The city successfully hosted Expo 2015. FieraMilano, the historical city trade fair operator, operates one of the largest expo areas in the world and the second in Europe (after Hannover) in the northern suburb of Rho, responsible for fairs such as Milan Furniture Fair, EICMA, EMO on 0.7 mln m² of exhibition areas with about 4.5 million visitors every year.Porta Nuova is the main business district of Milan, and one of the most important in Italy. Accenture, AXA, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Celgene, China Construction Bank, Finanza & Futuro Banca, FinecoBank, FM Global, Google, Herbalife, HSBC, KPMG, Maire Tecnimont, Microsoft, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Samsung, Shire, Tata Consultancy Services, Telecom Italia, UniCredit, UnipolSai and many other companies have their main Italian headquarters located there.\\nTourism is an increasingly important part of the city\\'s economy: with 8.81 million registered international arrivals in 2018 (up 9.92% on the previous year), Milan ranked as the world\\'s 15th-most visited city.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\n\\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\\n\\nMilan is home to many cultural institutions, museums and art galleries, that account for about a tenth of the national total of visitors and receipts. The Pinacoteca di Brera is one of Milan\\'s most important art galleries. It contains one of the foremost collections of Italian painting, including masterpieces such as the Brera Madonna by Piero della Francesca. The Castello Sforzesco hosts numerous art collections and exhibitions, especially statues, ancient arms and furnitures, as well as the Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco, with an art collection including Michelangelo\\'s last sculpture, the Rondanini Pietà, Andrea Mantegna\\'s Trivulzio Madonna and Leonardo da Vinci\\'s Codex Trivulzianus manuscript. The Castello complex also includes The Museum of Ancient Art, The Furniture Museum, The Museum of Musical Instruments and the Applied Arts Collection, The Egyptian and Prehistoric sections of the Archaeological Museum and the Achille Bertarelli Print Collection.\\nMilan\\'s figurative art flourished in the Middle Ages, and with the Visconti family being major patrons of the arts, the city became an important centre of Gothic art and architecture (Milan Cathedral being the city\\'s most formidable work of Gothic architecture). Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.The city was affected by the Baroque in the 17th and 18th centuries, and hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as Caravaggio and Francesco Hayez, which several important works are hosted in Brera Academy. The Museum of Risorgimento is specialised on the history of Italian unification Its collections include iconic paintings like Baldassare Verazzi\\'s Episode from the Five Days and Francesco Hayez\\'s 1840 Portrait of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. The Triennale is a design museum and events venue located in Palazzo dell\\'Arte, in Sempione Park. It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music, and media arts, emphasising the relationship between art and industry.\\nMilan in the 20th century was the epicentre of the Futurist artistic movement. Filippo Marinetti, the founder of Italian Futurism wrote in his 1909 \"Manifesto of Futurism\" (in Italian, Manifesto Futuristico), that Milan was \"grande...tradizionale e futurista\" (\"grand...traditional and futuristic\", in English). Umberto Boccioni was also an important Futurism artist who worked in the city. Today, Milan remains a major international hub of modern and contemporary art, with numerous modern art galleries. The Modern Art Gallery, situated in the Royal Villa, hosts collections of Italian and European painting from the 18th to the early 20th centuries.\\nThe Museo del Novecento, situated in the Palazzo dell\\'Arengario, is one of the most important art galleries in Italy about 20th-century art; of particular relevance are the sections dedicated to Futurism, Spatialism and Arte povera. In the early 1990s architect David Chipperfield was invited to convert the premises of the former Ansaldo Factory into a Museum. Museo delle Culture (MUDEC) opened in April 2015.\\nThe Gallerie di Piazza Scala, a modern and contemporary museum located in Piazza della Scala in the Palazzo Brentani and the Palazzo Anguissola, hosts 195 artworks from the collections of Fondazione Cariplo with a strong representation of nineteenth-century Lombard painters and sculptors, including Antonio Canova and Umberto Boccioni. A new section was opened in the Palazzo della Banca Commerciale Italiana in 2012. Other private ventures dedicated to contemporary art include the exhibiting spaces of the Prada Foundation and HangarBicocca. The Nicola Trussardi Foundation is renewed for organising temporary exhibition in venues around the city.\\nMilan is also home to many public art projects, with a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally renowned artists, including Arman, Kengiro Azuma, Francesco Barzaghi, Alberto Burri, Pietro Cascella, Maurizio Cattelan, Leonardo Da Vinci, Giorgio de Chirico, Kris Ruhs, Emilio Isgrò, Fausto Melotti, Joan Miró, Carlo Mo, Claes Oldenburg, Igor Mitoraj, Gianfranco Pardi, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Carlo Ramous, Aldo Rossi, Aligi Sassu, Giuseppe Spagnulo and Domenico Trentacoste.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nMilan is a major national and international centre of the performing arts, most notably opera. The city hosts La Scala operahouse, considered one of the world\\'s most prestigious, having throughout history witnessed the premieres of numerous operas, such as Nabucco by Giuseppe Verdi in 1842, La Gioconda by Amilcare Ponchielli, Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini in 1904, Turandot by Puccini in 1926, and more recently Teneke, by Fabio Vacchi in 2007. Other major theatres in Milan include the Teatro degli Arcimboldi, Teatro Dal Verme, Teatro Lirico and formerly the Teatro Regio Ducal. The city is also the seat of a renowned symphony orchestra and musical conservatory, and has been, throughout history, a major centre for musical composition: numerous famous composers and musicians such as Gioseppe Caimo, Simon Boyleau, Hoste da Reggio, Verdi, Giulio Gatti-Casazza, Paolo Cherici and Alice Edun lived and worked in Milan. The city is also the birthplace of many modern ensembles and bands, including Camaleonti, Camerata Mediolanense, Gli Spioni, Dynamis Ensemble, Elio e le Storie Tese, Krisma, Premiata Forneria Marconi, Quartetto Cetra, Stormy Six and Le Vibrazioni.\\n\\n\\n=== Fashion and design ===\\n\\nMilan is widely regarded as a global capital in industrial design, fashion and architecture. In the 1950s and 60s, as the main industrial centre of Italy and one of Europe\\'s most dynamic cities, Milan became a world capital of design and architecture. There was such a revolutionary change that Milan\\'s fashion exports accounted for US$726 million in 1952, and by 1955 that number grew to US$72.5 billion. Modern skyscrapers, such as the Pirelli Tower and the Torre Velasca were built, and artists such as Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni gathered in the city. Today, Milan is still particularly well known for its high-quality furniture and interior design industry. The city is home to FieraMilano, Europe\\'s largest permanent trade exhibition, and Salone Internazionale del Mobile, one of the most prestigious international furniture and design fairs.Milan is also regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world, along with New York City, Paris, and London. Milan is synonymous with the Italian prêt-à-porter industry, as many of the most famous Italian fashion brands, such as Valentino, Gucci, Versace, Prada, Armani and Dolce & Gabbana, are headquartered in the city. Numerous international fashion labels also operate shops in Milan. Furthermore, the city hosts the Milan Fashion Week twice a year, one of the most important events in the international fashion system. Milan\\'s main upscale fashion district, quadrilatero della moda, is home to the city\\'s most prestigious shopping streets (Via Monte Napoleone, Via della Spiga, Via Sant\\'Andrea, Via Manzoni and Corso Venezia), in addition to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the world\\'s oldest shopping malls.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages and literature ===\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The Enlightenment found here a fertile ground. Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria, with his famous Dei delitti e delle pene, and Count Pietro Verri, with the periodical Il Caffè were able to exert a considerable influence over the new middle-class culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the Romantic movement made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus Romantic poetry. Here, too, Giuseppe Parini, and Ugo Foscolo published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo\\'s poem Dei sepolcri was inspired by a Napoleonic law that—against the will of many of its inhabitants—was being extended to the city.\\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, Alessandro Manzoni wrote his novel I Promessi Sposi, considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period Carlo Porta, reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in Lombard Language. The periodical Il Conciliatore published articles by Silvio Pellico, Giovanni Berchet, Ludovico di Breme, who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\\nAfter the Unification of Italy in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus Realism and Naturalism gave birth to an Italian movement, Verismo. The greatest verista novelist, Giovanni Verga, was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the Milanese dialect or one of its Western Lombard variations.\\n\\n\\n=== Media ===\\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. Corriere della Sera, founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by Rizzoli, as well as La Gazzetta dello Sport, a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets Il Giorno, Il Giornale, the Roman Catholic Church-owned Avvenire, and Il Sole 24 Ore, a daily business newspaper owned by Confindustria (the Italian employers\\' federation). Free daily newspapers include Leggo and Metro.\\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including Abitare, Casabella, Domus, Flash Art, Gioia, Grazia, and Vogue Italia. Panorama and Oggi, two of Italy\\'s most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including Mediaset Group (owner of Canale 5, Italia 1, Iris and Rete 4), Telelombardia and MTV Italy. National radio stations based in Milan include Radio Deejay, Radio 105 Network, R101 (Italy), Radio Popolare, RTL 102.5, Radio Capital and Virgin Radio Italia.\\n\\n\\n=== Cuisine ===\\n\\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than vegetable oil and features almost no tomato or fish. Milanese traditional dishes includes cotoletta alla milanese, a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese Wiener Schnitzel). Other typical dishes are cassoeula (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with Savoy cabbage), ossobuco (braised veal shank served with a condiment called gremolata), risotto alla milanese (with saffron and beef marrow), busecca (stewed tripe with beans), and brasato (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\\nSeason-related pastries include chiacchiere (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and tortelli (fried spherical cookies) for Carnival, colomba (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, pane dei morti (\"bread of the (Day of the ) Dead\", cookies flavoured with cinnamon) for All Souls\\' Day and panettone for Christmas. The salame Milano, a salami with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. Renowned Milanese cheeses are gorgonzola (from the namesake village nearby), mascarpone, used in pastry-making, taleggio and quartirolo.\\nMilan is well known for its world-class restaurants and cafés, characterised by innovative cuisine and design. As of 2014, Milan has 157 Michelin-selected places, including three 2-Michelin-starred restaurants; these include Cracco, Sadler and il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia. Many historical restaurants and bars are found in the historic centre, the Brera and Navigli districts. One of the city\\'s oldest surviving cafés, Caffè Cova, was established in 1817. In total, Milan has 15 cafés, bars and restaurants registered among the Historical Places of Italy, continuously operating for at least 70 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Sport ===\\n\\nMilan hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1934 and 1990, the UEFA European Football Championship in 1980 and most recently the 2003 World Rowing Championships, the 2009 World Boxing Championships, and some games of the Men\\'s Volleyball World Championship in 2010 and the final games of the Women\\'s Volleyball World Championship in 2014. In 2018, Milan hosted World Figure Skating Championships. Milan will host the 2026 Winter Olympics as well as the 2026 Winter Paralympics jointly with Cortina d\\'Ampezzo.\\nMilan is the only city in Europe that is home to two European Cup/Champions League winning teams—Serie A renewed football clubs Milan and Inter. Both teams have also won the Intercontinental Cup (now FIFA Club World Cup). With a combined ten Champions League titles, Milan is second after Madrid as city that have won the most European Cups. They are one of the most successful clubs in the world of football in terms of international trophies. Both teams play at the UEFA 5-star-rated Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, more commonly known as the San Siro, that is one of the biggest stadiums in Europe, with a seating capacity of over 80,000. The Meazza Stadium hosted the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final, in which Real Madrid defeated Atlético Madrid 5–3 in a penalty shoot out. A third team, Brera Calcio F.C. plays in Promozione. Another team, Milano City F.C. (formerly of ASD Bustese) plays in Serie D.\\nThere are currently four professional Lega Basket clubs in Milan: Olimpia Milano, Pallacanestro Milano 1958, Società Canottieri Milano and A.S.S.I. Milano. Olimpia is the most titled basketball club in Italy, having won 27 Italian League championships, six Italian National Cups, one Italian Super Cup, three European Champions Cups, one FIBA Intercontinental Cup, three FIBA Saporta Cups, two FIBA Korać Cups and many junior titles. The team play at the Mediolanum Forum, with a capacity of 12,700 where it has been hosted the final of the 2013–14 Euroleague. In some cases the team play also at the PalaDesio, with a capacity of 6,700.\\nMilan is also home to Italy\\'s oldest American football team: Rhinos Milano, that won 5 Italian Super Bowls. The team play at the Velodromo Vigorelli, with a capacity of 8,000.

Its five major railway stations, such as the Milan Central station, are among Italy\\'s busiest.Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM) is the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Milan; it operates 4 metro lines (Milan Metro), 18 tram lines, 67 urban bus lines, 4 trolleybus lines, and 52 interurban bus lines, carrying over 734 million passengers in 2010. Overall the network covers nearly 1,500 km (932 mi) reaching 46 municipalities. Besides public transport, ATM manages the interchange parking lots and other transportation services including bike sharing and carsharing systems.\\n\\n\\n=== Rail ===\\n\\n\\n==== Underground ====\\nMilan Metro is the rapid transit system serving the city and surrounding municipalities. The network consists of 4 lines (plus one under construction), with a total network length of 101 kilometres (63 mi), and a total of 113 stations, mostly underground. It has a daily ridership of 1.15 million. one of the largest in Europe. \\n\\n\\n==== Suburban ====\\nThe Milan suburban railway service, operated by Trenord, comprises 12 lines and connects the metropolitan area with the city centre through the Milan Passerby underground railway. Commonly referred to as \"il Passante\", it has a train running every 6 minutes, functioning as a subway line with full transferability to the Milan Metro.\\n\\n\\n==== National and international trains ====\\nMilan Central station is the second station in Italy both for size and passengers after Rome. Milano Cadorna and Milano Porta Garibaldi stations are respectively the seventh and the eleventh busiest stations in Italy. Since the end of 2009, two high-speed train lines link Milan to Rome, Naples and Turin, considerably shortening travel times with other major cities in Italy. Further high-speed lines are under construction towards Genoa and Verona. Milan is served by direct international trains to Nice, Marseille, Lyon, Paris, Lugano, Geneva, Bern, Basel, Zurich and Frankfurt, and by overnight sleeper services to Paris and Dijon (Thello), Munich and Vienna (ÖBB).Milan is also the core of Lombardy\\'s regional train network. Regional trains were operated on two different systems by LeNord (departing from Milano Cadorna) and Trenitalia (departing from Milan Centrale and Milano Porta Garibaldi). Since 2011, a new company, Trenord, operates both Trenitalia and LeNord regional trains in Lombardy, carrying over 750,000 passengers on more than 50 routes every day.\\n\\n\\n=== Buses and trams ===\\nThe city tram network consists of approximately 160 kilometres (99 mi) of track and 18 lines, and is Europe\\'s most advanced light rail system. Bus lines cover over 1,070 km (665 mi). Milan has also taxi services operated by private companies and licensed by the City council of Milan. The city is also a key node for the national road network, being served by all the major highways of Northern Italy. Numerous long-distance bus lines link Milan with many other cities and towns in Lombardy and throughout Italy.\\n\\n\\n=== Aviation ===\\nThe Milan metropolitan area is served by three international airports, with a grand total of about 47 million passengers served in 2018.\\nMalpensa Airport is Italy\\'s second-busiest airport with 24.7 million passengers served in 2018 and Italy\\'s busiest for freight and cargo, handling about 600,000 tons of international freight in 2018. Malpensa is the major hub of the second largest national carrier, Air Italy. It lays 45 km (28 mi) from downtown Milan and is connected to the city by the Malpensa Express railway service.\\nLinate Airport, the oldest, is Milan\\'s city airport, and is now mainly used for domestic and short-haul international flights, serving 9.2 million passengers in 2018. Linate Airport is the second largest base for Italian nation\\'s flag carrier, Alitalia.\\nOrio al Serio Airport, located some 50 km (31 mi) away, near the town of Bergamo, mainly serves the low-cost traffic of Milan and it is the main base of Ryanair (12.9 million passengers served in 2018).Lastly, Bresso Airfield is a general aviation airport, operated by Aero Club Milano.\\n\\n\\n== International relations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Twin towns – sister cities ===\\nMilan has fifteen official sister cities as reported on the city\\'s website.

       "\"Venice  VEN-iss Italian Venezia veˈnɛttsja listen Venetian Venesia or Venexia, pronounced veˈnɛsja is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region It is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges The islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile In 2018, 260,897 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice centro storico Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area PATREVE, which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 26 millionThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for a millennium and more, from 697 to 1797 It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important center of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial center, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire, until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866, following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence\\nVenice has been known as La Dominante, La Serenissima, Queen of the Adriatic, City of Water, City of Masks, City of Bridges, The Floating City, and City of Canals The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi Although the city is facing some major challenges including financial difficulties, pollution, an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by cruise ships sailing close to the buildings, Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, an iconic Italian city, and has been ranked the most beautiful city in the world\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe name of the city, deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae, is most likely taken from Venetia et Histria, the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy, but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic, Lombard, and Frankish control The name Venetia, however, derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti, and called by the Greeks Enetoi Ἐνετοί The meaning of the word is uncertain, although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names, such as the Celtic Veneti and the Slavic Vistula Veneti Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root *wen love, so that *wenetoi would mean beloved, lovable, or friendly A connection with the Latin word venetus, meaning the color 'sea-blue', is also possible\\nSupposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire to come, such as Marin Sanudo's veni etiam Yet, I have come!, the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland, or even with venia forgiveness are fanciful The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia viˈnɛːdʒa Venetian Venèxia veˈnɛzja Latin Venetiae Slovene Benetke Croatian Venecija\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n Origins \\n\\nAlthough no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice, tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees—from nearby Roman cities such as Padua, Aquileia, Treviso, Altino, and Concordia modern Portogruaro, as well as from the undefended countryside—who were fleeing successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions This is further supported by the documentation on the so-called apostolic families, the twelve founding families of Venice who elected the first doge, who in most cases trace their lineage back to Roman families Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen, on the islands in the original marshy lagoons, who were referred to as incolae lacunae lagoon dwellers The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo on the islet of Rialto Rivoalto, High Shore—said to have taken place at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421 the Feast of the AnnunciationBeginning as early as AD 166–168, the Quadi and Marcomanni destroyed the main Roman town in the area, present-day Oderzo This part of Roman Italy was again overrun in the early 5th century by the Visigoths and, some 50 years later, by the Huns led by Attila The last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the Lombards in 568, left the Eastern Roman Empire only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the Exarchate of Ravenna, administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy the Exarch appointed by the Emperor in Constantinople Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came increasing autonomy New ports were built, including those at Malamocco and Torcello in the Venetian lagoon The tribuni maiores formed the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the lagoon, dating from c 568\\n\\nThe traditional first doge of Venice, Paolo Lucio Anafesto Anafestus Paulicius, was elected in 697, as written in the oldest chronicle by John, deacon of Venice c\\u20091008 Some modern historians claim Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually the Exarch Paul, and Paul's successor, Marcello Tegalliano, was Paul's magister militum or general, literally master of soldiers In 726 the soldiers and citizens of the exarchate rose in a rebellion over the iconoclastic controversy, at the urging of Pope Gregory II The exarch, held responsible for the acts of his master, Byzantine Emperor Leo III, was murdered, and many officials were put to flight in the chaos At about this time, the people of the lagoon elected their own independent leader for the first time, although the relationship of this to the uprisings is not clear Ursus was the first of 117 doges doge is the Venetian dialectal equivalent of the Latin dux leader the corresponding word in English is duke, in standard Italian duca  See also duce Whatever his original views, Ursus supported Emperor Leo III's successful military expedition to recover Ravenna, sending both men and ships In recognition of this, Venice was granted numerous privileges and concessions and Ursus, who had personally taken the field, was confirmed by Leo as dux and given the added title of hypatus from the Greek for consulIn 751, the Lombard King Aistulf conquered most of the Exarchate of Ravenna, leaving Venice a lonely and increasingly autonomous Byzantine outpost During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor the duke/dux, later doge, was at Malamocco Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories, as refugees sought asylum in the area In 775/6, the episcopal seat of Olivolo San Pietro di Castello, namely Helipolis was created During the reign of duke Agnello Particiaco 811–827 the ducal seat moved from Malamocco to the more protected Rialto, within present-day Venice The monastery of St Zachary and the first ducal palace and basilica of St Mark, as well as a walled defense civitatis murus between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here\\nCharlemagne sought to subdue the city to his rule He ordered the pope to expel the Venetians from the Pentapolis along the Adriatic coast Charlemagne's own son Pepin of Italy, king of the Lombards, under the authority of his father, embarked on a siege of Venice itself This, however, proved a costly failure The siege lasted six months, with Pepin's army ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and eventually forced to withdraw in 810 A few months later, Pepin himself died, apparently as a result of a disease contracted there In the aftermath, an agreement between Charlemagne and the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus in 814 recognized Venice as Byzantine territory, and granted the city trading rights along the Adriatic coast\\nIn 828 the new city's prestige increased with the acquisition, from Alexandria, of relics claimed to be of St Mark the Evangelist these were placed in the new basilica Winged lions—visible throughout Venice—are the emblem of St Mark  The patriarchal seat was also moved to Rialto As the community continued to develop, and as Byzantine power waned, its own autonomy grew, leading to eventual independence\\n\\n\\n Expansion \\n\\nFrom the 9th to the 12th century, Venice developed into a city state an Italian thalassocracy or repubblica marinara there  were three others  Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi Its own strategic position at the head of the Adriatic made Venetian naval and commercial power almost invulnerable With the elimination of pirates along the Dalmatian coast, the city became a flourishing trade center between Western Europe and the rest of the world—especially with the Byzantine Empire and Asia, where its navy protected sea routes against piracy\\n\\nThe Republic of Venice seized a number of places on the eastern shores of the Adriatic before 1200, mostly for commercial reasons, because pirates based there were a menace to trade The doge already possessed the titles of Duke of Dalmatia and Duke of Istria Later mainland possessions, which extended across Lake Garda as far west as the Adda River, were known as the Terraferma they were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee Alpine trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat on which the city depended In building its maritime commercial empire, Venice \\ndominated the trade in salt, \\nacquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean, including Crete, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, and \\nbecame a major power-broker in the Near East By the standards of the time, Venice's stewardship of its mainland territories was relatively enlightened and the citizens of such towns as Bergamo, Brescia, and Verona rallied to the defence of Venetian sovereignty when it was threatened by invaders\\nVenice remained closely associated with Constantinople, being twice granted trading privileges in the Eastern Roman Empire, through the so-called golden bulls or chrysobulls, in return for aiding the Eastern Empire to resist Norman and Turkish incursions In the first chrysobull, Venice acknowledged its homage to the empire but not in the second, reflecting the decline of Byzantium and the rise of Venice's powerVenice became an imperial power following the Fourth Crusade, which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking Constantinople and establishing the Latin Empire As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to Venice This plunder included the gilt bronze horses from the Hippodrome of Constantinople, which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of Venice, St Mark's Basilica The originals have been replaced with replicas, and are now stored within the basilica  After the fall of Constantinople, the former Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the Duchy of the Archipelago, and captured Crete\\n\\nThe seizure of Constantinople proved as decisive a factor in ending the Byzantine Empire as the loss of the Anatolian themes, after Manzikert Although the Byzantines recovered control of the ravaged city a half-century later, the Byzantine Empire was terminally weakened, and existed as a ghost of its old self, until Sultan Mehmet The Conqueror took the city in 1453\\n\\nSituated on the Adriatic Sea, Venice had always traded extensively with the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim world By the late 13th century, Venice was the most prosperous city in all of Europe At the peak of its power and wealth, it had 36,000 sailors operating 3,300 ships, dominating Mediterranean commerce Venice's leading families vied with each other to build the grandest palaces and to support the work of the greatest and most talented artists The city was governed by the Great Council, which was made up of members of the noble families of Venice The Great Council appointed all public officials, and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals Since this group was too large for efficient administration, a Council of Ten also called the Ducal Council, or the Signoria, controlled much of the administration of the city One member of the great council was elected doge, or duke, to be the chief executive he would usually hold the title until his death, although several Doges were forced, by pressure from their oligarchical peers, to resign and retire into monastic seclusion, when they were felt to have been discredited by political failure\\nThe Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome, with an elected chief executive the doge, a senator-like assembly of nobles, and the general citizenry with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected doge \\nChurch and various private properties were tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself \\nThe Cavalieri di San Marco was the only order of chivalry ever instituted in Venice, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent \\nVenice remained a republic throughout its independent period, \\nand politics and the military were kept separate, \\nexcept when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military \\nWar was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means \\nwhence, \\nthe city's early employment of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and \\nlater its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce\\n\\n\\nAlthough the people of Venice generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, \\nthe state of Venice was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism, \\nand executed nobody for religious heresy during the Counter-Reformation \\nThis apparent lack of zeal contributed to Venice's frequent conflicts with the papacy \\nIn this context, the writings of the Anglican divine William Bedell are particularly illuminating \\nVenice was threatened with the interdict on a number of occasions \\nand twice suffered its imposition \\nThe second, most noted, occasion was in 1606, by order of Pope Paul V\\nVenetian ambassadors sent home still-extant secret reports of the politics and rumours of European courts, providing fascinating information to modern historiansThe newly invented German printing press spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 15th century, and Venice was quick to adopt it \\nBy 1482, Venice was the printing capital of the world \\nthe leading printer was Aldus Manutius, who invented paperback books that could be carried in a saddlebag\\nHis Aldine Editions included translations of nearly all the known Greek manuscripts of the \\nera\\n\\n\\n Decline \\n\\nVenice's long decline started in the 15th century, when it first made an unsuccessful attempt to hold Thessalonica against the Ottomans 1423–1430 It also sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks 1453 After Constantinople fell to Sultan Mehmet II, he declared the first of a series of Ottoman-Venetian wars that cost Venice much of its eastern Mediterranean possessions Even more decisive than the Columbian exchange and the beginning of Atlantic trade following Christopher Columbus's voyage of 1492 was Vasco da Gama's first voyage of 1497–99, which opened a sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope and destroyed Venice's monopoly France, England, and the Dutch Republic quickly followed Spain and Portugal, but Venice's oared galleys were at a disadvantage when it came to traversing the great oceans, and therefore Venice was left behind in the race for colonies\\nThe Black Death devastated Venice in 1348, and once again between 1575 and 1577 In three years, the plague killed some 50,000 people In 1630, the Italian plague of 1629–31 killed a third of Venice's 150,000 citizens Venice began to lose its position as a center of international trade during the later part of the Renaissance as Portugal became Europe's principal intermediary in the trade with the East, striking at the very foundation of Venice's great wealth while France and Spain fought for hegemony over Italy in the Italian Wars, marginalising its political influence However, the Venetian empire remained a major exporter of agricultural products, and until the mid-18th century, a significant manufacturing center\\n\\n\\n Modern age \\n\\nDuring the 18th century, Venice became perhaps the most elegant and refined city in Europe, greatly influencing art, architecture, and literature But the Republic lost its independence when Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Venice on 12 May 1797 during the War of the First Coalition Napoleon was seen as something of a liberator by the city's Jewish population, although it can be argued they had lived with fewer restrictions in Venice than elsewhere He removed the gates of the Ghetto and ended the restrictions on when and where Jews could live and travel in the city\\nVenice became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio on 12 October 1797 The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798 Venice was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy It was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia In 1848 and 1849, a revolt briefly re-established the Venetian republic under Daniele Manin In 1866, after the Third Italian War of Independence, Venice, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created Kingdom of Italy\\n\\nDuring the Second World War, the historic city was largely free from attack, the only aggressive effort of note being Operation Bowler, a successful Royal Air Force precision strike on the German naval operations in the city in March 1945 The targets were destroyed with virtually no architectural damage inflicted on the city itself However, the industrial areas in Mestre and Marghera and the railway lines to Padua, Trieste, and Trento were repeatedly bombed On 29 April 1945, a force of British and New Zealand troops of the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant General Freyberg, liberated Venice, which had been a hotbed of anti-Mussolini Italian partisan activity\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\nVenice sits atop alluvial silt washed into the sea by the rivers flowing eastward from the alps across the Veneto plain, with the silt being stretched into long banks, or lidi, by the action of the current flowing around the head of the Adriatic Sea from east to west\\n\\n\\n Subsidence \\n\\nSubsidence, the gradual lowering of the surface of Venice, has led to the seasonal Acqua alta high water when much of the city's surface is occasionally covered at high tide\\n\\n\\n= Building foundations =\\nThose fleeing Barbarian invasions who found refuge on the sandy islands of Torcello, Iesolo, and Malamocco, in this coastal lagoon, learned to build by driving closely spaced piles consisting of the trunks of alder trees, a wood noted for its water resistance, into the mud and sand, until they reached a much harder layer of compressed clay Building foundations rested on plates of Istrian limestone placed on top of the piles\\n\\n\\n= Flooding =\\nBetween autumn and early spring, the city is often threatened by flood tides pushing in from the Adriatic Six hundred years ago, Venetians protected themselves from land-based attacks by diverting all the major rivers flowing into the lagoon and thus preventing sediment from filling the area around the city This created an ever-deeper lagoon environment\\nIn 1604, to defray the cost of flood relief, Venice introduced what could be considered the first example of a stamp tax When the revenue fell short of expectations in 1608, Venice introduced paper, with the superscription AQ and imprinted instructions, which was to be used for letters to officials At first, this was to be a temporary tax, but it remained in effect until the fall of the Republic in 1797 Shortly after the introduction of the tax, Spain produced similar paper for general taxation purposes, and the practice spread to other countries\\nDuring the 20th century, when many artesian wells were sunk into the periphery of the lagoon to draw water for local industry, Venice began to subside It was realized that extraction of water from the aquifer was the cause The sinking has slowed markedly since artesian wells were banned in the 1960s However, the city is still threatened by more frequent low-level floods—the Acqua alta, that rise to a height of several centimetres over its quays—regularly following certain tides In many old houses, staircases once used to unload goods are now flooded, rendering the former ground floor uninhabitable\\nStudies indicate that the city continues sinking at a relatively slow rate of 1–2 mm per annum therefore, the state of alert has not been revoked In May 2003, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi inaugurated the MOSE Project Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, an experimental model for evaluating the performance of hollow floatable gates the idea is to fix a series of 78 hollow pontoons to the sea bed across the three entrances to the lagoon When tides are predicted to rise above 110 centimetres, the pontoons will be filled with air, causing them to float and block the incoming water from the Adriatic Sea This engineering work is due to be completed by 2018The project is not guaranteed to be successful and the cost has been very high, according to a spokesman for the FAI similar to the National Trust\\n\\nMose is a pharaonic project that should have cost €800m £675m but will cost at least €7bn £6bn If the barriers are closed at only 90cm of high water, most of St Mark's will be flooded anyway but if closed at very high levels only, then people will wonder at the logic of spending such sums on something that didn't solve the problem And pressure will come from the cruise ships to keep the gates open\\nApproximately €2 billion of the cost has been lost to corruption\\n\\n\\n Climate \\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Venice has a humid subtropical climate Cfa, with cool winters and hot, humid summers The 24-hour average temperature in January is 33 °C 379 °F, and for July this figure is 230 °C 734 °F Precipitation is spread relatively evenly throughout the year, and averages 748 millimetres 294 in\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\nThe city was one of the largest in Europe in the High Middle Ages, with a population of 60,000 in AD 1000 80,000 in 1200 and rising up to 110,000–180,000 in 1300 In the mid 1500s the city's population was 170,000, and by 1600 almost 200,000In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in the Comune of Venice the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice Centro storico, 176,000 in Terraferma the mainland and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon 474% were male and 526% were female Minors ages 18 and younger were 1436% of the population compared to pensioners who numbered 257% This compared with the Italian average of 1806% and 1994%, respectively The average age of Venice residents was 46 compared to the Italian average of 42 In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Venice declined by 02%, while Italy as a whole grew by 385% The population in the historic old city declined much faster from about 120,000 in 1980 to about 60,000 in 2009, and to below 55,000 in 2016As of 2009, 91% of the population was Italian The largest immigrant groups include Romanians, 3% South Asia, 13% and East Asia, 09%\\nVenice is predominantly Roman Catholic 927% of the resident population in the area of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice in 2012, but because of the long-standing relationship with Constantinople, there is also a noticeable Orthodox presence and as a result of immigration, there are now some Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist inhabitants\\nSince 1991, the Church of San Giorgio dei Greci in Venice has become the see of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe, a Byzantine-rite diocese under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of ConstantinopleThere is also a historic Jewish community in Venice The Venetian Ghetto was the area in which Jews were compelled to live under the Venetian Republic The word ghetto, originally Venetian, is now found in many languages Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, written in the late 16th century, features Shylock, a Venetian Jew The first complete and uncensored printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg in 1523 During World War II, Jews were rounded up in Venice and deported to extermination camps Since the end of the war, the Jewish population of Venice has declined from 1500 to about 500 Only around 30 Jews live in the former ghetto which houses the city's major Jewish institutions In modern times, Venice has an eruv, used by the Jewish community\\n\\n\\n== Government ==\\n\\n\\n Sestieri \\n\\nThe whole pensolon municipality is divided into 6 boroughs \\nOne of these the historic city is in turn divided into six areas called sestieri \\n\\nCannaregio including San Michele,\\nSan Polo,\\nDorsoduro including Giudecca and Sacca Fisola,\\nSanta Croce,\\nSan Marco including San Giorgio Maggiore and\\nCastello including San Pietro di Castello and Sant'ElenaEach sestiere was administered by a procurator and his staff \\nNow, each sestiere is a statistical and historical area without any degree of autonomy \\nThe six fingers or phalanges of the ferro on the bow of a gondola represent the six sestieri\\nThe sestieri are divided into parishes – initially 70 in 1033, but reduced under Napoleon, and now numbering just 38 These parishes predate the sestieri, which were created in about 1170 Each parish exhibited unique characteristics but also belonged to an integrated network Each community chose its own patron saint, staged its own festivals, congregated around its own market center, constructed its own bell towers, and developed its own customsOther islands of the Venetian Lagoon do not form part of any of the sestieri, having historically enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy\\nEach sestiere has its own house numbering system Each house has a unique number in the district, from one to several thousand, generally numbered from one corner of the area to another, but not usually in a readily understandable manner\\n\\n\\n Municipality \\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nThe legislative body of the Comune is the Consiglio Comunale city council, which is composed of 45 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections The executive body is the City Committee Giunta Comunale, composed of 12 assessors nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor\\nVenice was governed by center-left parties from the 1990s until the 2010s, when the mayor started to be elected directly Its region Veneto has long been a conservative stronghold, with the coalition between the regionalist Lega Nord and the center-right Forza Italia winning absolute majorities of the electorate in many elections at communal, national, and regional levels\\nIn June 2015, after a corruption scandal that forced the center-left mayor Giorgio Orsoni to resign, Venice voted for the first time for a conservative directly-elected mayor the center-right businessman Luigi Brugnaro won the election in the second round of voting, with 53% of the votes against the leftist magistrate, and member of the Italian Senate, Felice Casson, who led in the first round with 38% of the votes\\n\\nThe municipality of Venice is subdivided into six administrative boroughs municipalità Each borough is governed by a council Consiglio and a president, elected contextually to the city Mayor The urban organisation is dictated by Article 114 of the Italian constitution The boroughs have the power to advise the mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics environment, construction, public health, local markets and exercise the functions delegated to them by the city council in addition, they are supplied with autonomous funding to finance local activities The boroughs are\\nLagoon area\\n\\nVenezia historic city –Murano–Burano also known as Venezia insulare population 69,136\\nLido–Pellestrina also known as Venezia litorale population 21,664Mainland terraferma, annexed with a Royal Decree, in 1926, to the municipality of Venezia\\n\\nFavaro Veneto population 23,615\\nMestre–Carpenedo also known as Mestre centro population 88,952\\nChirignago–Zelarino population 38,179\\nMarghera population 28,466After the 2015 elections, five of the six boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party and its allies, and one by the center-right mayoral majority\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\nVenice's economy has changed throughout history Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the Levant Venice's location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the Brenner Pass over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Venice was a major center for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs, From the 11th century until the 15th century, pilgrimages to the Holy Land were offered in Venice Other ports such as Genoa, Pisa, Marseille, Ancona, and Dubrovnik were hardly able to compete with the well organized transportation of pilgrims from Venice\\n\\nThis all changed by the 17th century, when Venice's trade empire was taken over by countries such as Portugal, and its importance as a naval power was reduced In the 18th century, then, it became a major agricultural and industrial exporter The 18th century's biggest industrial complex was the Venice Arsenal, and the Italian Army still uses it today even though some space has been used for major theatrical and cultural productions, and as spaces for art Since World War II, many Venetians have moved to the neighboring cities of Mestre and Porto Marghera, seeking employment as well as affordable housingToday, Venice's economy is mainly based on tourism, shipbuilding mainly in Mestre and Porto Marghera, services, trade, and industrial exports Murano glass production in Murano and lace production in Burano are also highly important to the economyThe city is facing financial challenges In late 2016, it had a major deficit in its budget and debts in excess of  €400 million In effect, the place is bankrupt, according to a report by The Guardian Many locals are leaving the historic center due to rapidly increasing rents The declining native population affects the character of the city, as an October 2016 National Geographic article pointed out in its subtitle Residents are abandoning the city, which is in danger of becoming an overpriced theme park The city is also facing other challenges, including erosion, pollution, subsidence, an excessive number of tourists in peak periods, and problems caused by oversized cruise ships sailing close to the banks of the historical cityIn June 2017, Italy was required to bail out two Venetian banks—the Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca—to prevent their bankruptcies Both banks would be wound down and their assets that have value taken over by another Italian bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, which would receive €52 billion as compensation The Italian government would be responsible for losses from any uncollectible loans from the closed banks The cost would be €52 billion, with further guarantees to cover bad loans totaling €12 billion\\n\\n\\n Tourism \\n\\nVenice is an important destination for tourists who want to see its celebrated art and architecture The city hosts up to 60,000 tourists per day 2017 estimate Estimates of the annual number of tourists vary from 22 million to 30 million This overtourism creates overcrowding and environmental problems for Venice's ecosystem By 2017, UNESCO was considering the addition of Venice to its In-Danger list, which includes historical ruins in war-torn countries To reduce the number of visitors, who are causing irreversible changes in Venice, the agency supports limiting the number of cruise ships as well as implementing a strategy for more sustainable tourismTourism has been a major part of the Venetian economy since the 18th century, when Venice—with its beautiful cityscape, uniqueness, and rich musical and artistic cultural heritage—was a stop on the Grand Tour In the 19th century, Venice became a fashionable centre for the rich and famous, who often stayed and dined at luxury establishments such as the Danieli Hotel and the Caffè Florian, and continued to be a fashionable city into the early 20th century In the 1980s, the Carnival of Venice was revived and the city has become a major centre of international conferences and festivals, such as the prestigious Venice Biennale and the Venice Film Festival, which attract visitors from all over the world for their theatrical, cultural, cinematic, artistic, and musical productionsToday, there are numerous attractions in Venice, such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, the Grand Canal, and the Piazza San Marco The Lido di Venezia is also a popular international luxury destination, attracting thousands of actors, critics, celebrities, and others in the cinematic industry The city also relies heavily on the cruise business The Cruise Venice Committee has estimated that cruise ship passengers spend more than 150 million euros US$193 million annually in the city, according to a 2015 report Other reports, however, point out that such day-trippers spend relatively little in the few hours of their visits to the cityVenice is regarded by some as a tourist trap, and by others as a living museum Unlike most other places in Western Europe, and the world, Venice has become widely known for its element of elegant decay The competition for foreigners to buy homes in Venice has made prices rise so high that numerous inhabitants are forced to move to more affordable areas of Veneto and Italy\\n\\n\\n= Mitigating the effects of tourism =\\nThe need to protect the city's historic environment and fragile canals, in the face of a possible loss of jobs produced by cruise tourism, has seen the Italian Transport Ministry attempt to introduce a ban on large cruise ships visiting the city A 2013 ban would have allowed only cruise ships smaller than 40,000-gross tons to enter the Giudecca Canal and St Mark's basin In January, a regional court scrapped the ban, but some global cruise lines indicated that they would continue to respect it until a long-term solution for the protection of Venice is found\\n\\nFor example, P&O Cruises removed Venice from its summer schedule, Holland America moved one of its ships from this area to Alaska, and Cunard is reducing in 2017 and further in 2018 the number of visits by its ships As a result, the Venice Port Authority estimated an 114 per cent drop in cruise ships arriving in 2017 versus 2016, leading to a similar reduction in income for Venice\\n\\nHaving failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the city switched to a new strategy in mid-2017, banning the creation of any additional hotels Currently, there are over 24,000 hotel rooms The ban does not affect short-term rentals in the historic center which are causing an increase in the cost of living for the native residents of Venice The city had already banned any additional fast food take-away outlets, to retain the historic character of the city, which was another reason for freezing the number of hotel rooms Fewer than half of the millions of annual visitors stay overnight, howeverThe city also considered a ban on wheeled suitcases, but settled for banning hard plastic wheels for transporting cargo from May 2015In addition to accelerating erosion of the ancient city's foundations and creating some pollution in the lagoon, cruise ships dropping an excessive number of day trippers can make St Marks Square and other popular attractions too crowded to walk through during the peak season Government officials see little value to the economy from the eat and flee tourists who stay for less than a day, which is typical of those from cruise shipsSome locals continued to aggressively lobby for new methods that would reduce the number of cruise ship passengers their estimate indicated that there are up to 30,000 such sightseers per day at peak periods, while others concentrate their effort on promoting a more responsible way of visiting the city An unofficial referendum to ban large cruise ships was held in June 2017 More than 18,000 people voted at 60 polling booths set up by activists, and 17,874 favored banning large ships from the lagoon The population of Venice at the time was about 50,000 The organizers of the referendum backed a plan to build a new cruise ship terminal at one of the three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon Passengers would be transferred to the historic area in smaller boatsIn the last week of 2018, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro announced that, under a new Italian law, day-trippers visiting the historic centre would be required to pay a new tax, whose extra revenue would be used for cleaning, maintaining security, reducing the financial burden on residents of Venice, and to allow Venetians to live with more decorum The new tax had not yet been set, but the mayor was considering an amount somewhere between €250 and €10 per person, with exemptions for a few types of travelers, including students Overnight visitors, who already pay a stay tax but account for only one-fifth of Venice's yearly total of 30 million visitors, would also be exempted The plan to charge day-trippers an entrance fee into the city of up to €10 was expected come into effect in September 2019, an attempt to reduce their numbers\\n\\n\\n= Diverting cruise ships =\\n\\nHaving failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the Italian inter-ministerial Comitatone overseeing Venice's lagoon released an official directive in November 2017 to keep the largest cruise ships away from the Piazza San Marco and the entrance to the Grand Canal Ships over 55,000 tons will be required to follow a specific route through the Vittorio Emmanuele III Canal to reach Marghera, an industrial area of the mainland, where a passenger terminal would be built\\n\\nIn 2014, the United Nations warned the city that it may be placed on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger sites unless cruise ships are banned from the canals near the historic centreAccording to the officials, the plan to create an alternate route for ships would require extensive dredging of the canal and the building of a new port, which would take four years, in total, to complete However, the activist group No Grandi Navi No big Ships, argued that the effects of pollution caused by the ships would not be diminished by the re-routing planOn 2 June 2019, the cruise ship MSC Opera rammed a tourist riverboat, the River Countess, which was docked on the Giudecca Canal, injuring five people, in addition to causing property damage The incident immediately led to renewed demands to ban large cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, including a Twitter message to that effect posted by the environment minister The city's mayor urged authorities to accelerate the steps required for cruise ships to begin using the alternate Vittorio Emanuele canal Italy's transport minister spoke of a solution to protect both the lagoon and tourism  after many years of inertia but specifics were not reported As of June 2019, the 2017 plan to establish an alternative route for large ships, preventing them from coming near the historic area of the city, has not yet been approvedNonetheless, the Italian government released an announcement on 7 August 2019 that it would begin rerouting cruise ships larger than 1000 tonnes away from the historic city's Giudecca Canal For the last four months of 2019, all heavy vessels will dock at the Fusina and Lombardia terminals which are still on the lagoon but away from the central islands By 2020, one-third of all cruise ships will be rerouted, according to Danilo Toninelli, the minister for Venice Preparation work for the Vittorio Emanuele Canal needed to begin soon for a long-term solution, according to the Cruise Lines International Association In the long-term, space for ships would be provided at new terminals, perhaps at Chioggia or Lido San Nicolo That plan was not imminent however, since public consultations had not yet begun Over 15 million people per year arrive in Venice on cruise ships\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\n\\n In the historic centre \\n\\nVenice is built on an archipelago of 118 islands in a shallow, 550 km2 212 sq mi lagoon, connected by 400 bridges over 177 canals In the 19th century, a causeway to the mainland brought the railroad to Venice The adjoining Ponte della Libertà road causeway and terminal parking facilities in Tronchetto island and Piazzale Roma were built during the 20th century Beyond these rail and road terminals on the northern edge of the city, transportation within the city's historic centre remains, as it was in centuries past, entirely on water or on foot Venice is Europe's largest urban car-free area and is unique in Europe in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks\\nThe classic Venetian boat is the gondola, plural gondole although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as traghetti sing traghetto to cross the Grand Canal in lieu of a nearby bridge The traghetti are operated by two oarsmen For some years there were seven such boats but by 2017, only three remainedThere are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in Venice, in their distinctive livery, and a similar number of boats, down from 10,000 two centuries ago Many gondolas are lushly appointed with crushed velvet seats and Persian rugs At the front of each gondola that works in the city, there is a large piece of metal called the fèro iron Its shape has evolved through the centuries, as documented in many well-known paintings Its form, topped by a likeness of the Doge's hat, became gradually standardized, and was then fixed by local law It consists of six bars pointing forward representing the sestieri of the city, and one that points backwards representing the Giudecca A lesser-known boat is the smaller, simpler, but similar, sandolo\\n\\n\\n= Waterways =\\n\\nVenice's small islands were enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soil to raise the marshy ground above the tides The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city\\nThe maze of canals threading through the city requires more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic In 2011, the city opened the Ponte della Costituzione, the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, which connects the Piazzale Roma bus-terminal area with the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station The other bridges are the original Ponte di Rialto, the Ponte dell'Accademia, and the Ponte degli Scalzi\\n\\n\\n Public transport \\nAzienda del Consorzio Trasporti

of the arts Venice at the time was a rich and prosperous Maritime Republic, which controlled a vast sea and trade empireIn the 16th century, Venetian painting was developed through influences from the Paduan School and Antonello da Messina, who introduced the oil painting technique of the Van Eyck brothers It is signified by a warm colour scale and a picturesque use of colour Early masters were the

techniquesCanvases the common painting surface originated in Venice during the early Renaissance These early canvases were generally rough\\nIn the 18th century, Venetian painting had a revival with Tiepolo's decorative painting and Canaletto's and Guardi's panoramic views\\n\\n\\n Venetian architecture \\n\\nVenice is built on unstable mud-banks, and had a very crowded city centre by the Middle Ages On the other hand, the city was largely safe from riot, civil feuds, and invasion much earlier than most European cities These factors, with the canals and the great wealth of the city, made for unique building styles\\nVenice has a rich and diverse architectural style, the most prominent of which is the Gothic style Venetian Gothic architecture is a term given to a Venetian building style combining the use of the Gothic lancet arch with the curved ogee arch, due to Byzantine and Ottoman influences The style originated in 14th-century Venice, with a confluence of Byzantine style from Constantinople, Islamic influences from Spain and Venice's eastern trading partners, and early Gothic forms from mainland Italy Chief examples of the style are the Doge's Palace and the Ca' d'Oro in the city The city also has several Renaissance and Baroque buildings, including the Ca' Pesaro and the Ca' Rezzonico\\nVenetian taste was conservative and Renaissance architecture only really became popular in buildings from about the 1470s  More than in the rest of Italy, it kept much of the typical form of the Gothic palazzi, which had evolved to suit Venetian conditions In turn the transition to Baroque architecture was also fairly gentle This gives the crowded buildings on the Grand Canal and elsewhere an essential harmony, even where buildings from very different periods sit together For example, round-topped arches are far more common in Renaissance buildings than elsewhere\\n\\n\\n Rococo style \\nIt can be argued that Venice produced the best and most refined rococo designs At the time, the Venician economy was in decline  It had lost most of its maritime power, was lagging behind its rivals in political importance, and its society had become decadent, with tourism increasingly the mainstay of the economy But Venice remained a centre of fashion Venetian rococo was well known as rich and luxurious, with usually very extravagant designs Unique Venetian furniture types included the divani da portego, and long rococo couches and pozzetti, objects meant to be placed against the wall Bedrooms of rich Venetians were usually sumptuous and grand, with rich damask, velvet, and silk drapery and curtains, and beautifully carved rococo beds with statues of putti, flowers, and angels Venice was especially known for its beautiful girandole mirrors, which remained among, if not the, finest in Europe Chandeliers were usually very colourful, using Murano glass to make them look more vibrant and stand out from others and precious stones and materials from abroad were used, since Venice still held a vast trade empire Lacquer was very common, and many items of furniture were covered with it, the most noted being lacca povera poor lacquer, in which allegories and images of social life were painted Lacquerwork and Chinoiserie were particularly common in bureau cabinets\\n\\n\\n Glass \\n\\nVenice is known for its ornate glass-work, known as Venetian glass, which is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skilfully made\\n\\nMany of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the 13th century Toward the end of that century, the center of the Venetian glass industry moved to Murano, an offshore island in Venice The glass made there is known as Murano glass\\n\\nByzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass When Constantinople was sacked in the Fourth Crusade in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice This happened again when the Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers By the 16th century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the color and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques\\nDespite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe\\nSome of the most important brands of glass in the world today are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano They are Venini, Barovier & Toso, Pauly, Millevetri, and Seguso Barovier & Toso is considered one of the 100 oldest companies in the world, formed in 1295\\n\\n\\n Festivals \\n\\nThe Carnival of Venice is held annually in the city, It lasts for around two weeks and ends on Shrove Tuesday Venetian masks are worn\\nThe Venice Biennale is one of the most important events in the arts calendar In 1895 an Esposizione biennale artistica nazionale biennial exhibition of Italian art was inaugurated In September 1942, the activities of the Biennale were interrupted by the war, but resumed in 1948The Festa del Redentore is held in mid-July It began as a feast to give thanks for the end of the plague of 1576 A bridge of barges is built connecting Giudecca to the rest of Venice, and fireworks play an important role\\nThe Venice Film Festival Italian Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica di Venezia is the oldest film festival in the world Founded by Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata in 1932 as the Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica, the festival has since taken place every year in late August or early September on the island of the Lido Screenings take place in the historic Palazzo del Cinema on the Lungomare Marconi It is one of the world's most prestigious film festivals and is part of the Venice Biennale\\n\\n\\n Music \\n\\nThe city of Venice in Italy has played an important role in the development of the music of Italy The Venetian state – ie, the medieval Republic of Venice – was often popularly called the Republic of Music, and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing There is music everywhereDuring the 16th century, Venice became one of the most important musical centers of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition the Venetian school and the development of the Venetian polychoral style under composers such as Adrian Willaert, who worked at St Mark's Basilica Venice was the early center of music printing Ottaviano Petrucci began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and Flanders By the end of the century, Venice was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the colossal style of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, which used multiple choruses and instrumental groups Venice was also the home of many noted composers during the baroque period, such as Antonio Vivaldi, Ippolito Ciera, Giovanni Picchi, and Girolamo Dalla Casa,

professional and amateur Fulvio Roiter has probably been the pioneer in artistic photography in Venice, followed by a number of photographers whose works are often reproduced on postcards, thus reaching a widest international popular exposure\\n\\n\\n Cuisine \\n\\nVenetian cuisine is characterized by seafood, but also includes garden products from the islands of the lagoon, rice from the

Senate passed sumptuary laws, but these merely resulted in changes in fashion in order to circumvent the law Dull garments were worn over colourful ones, which then were cut to show the hidden colours resulting in the spread of men's slashed fashions in the 15th century\\nToday, Venice is a major fashion and shopping centre not as important as Milan, Florence, and Rome, but on a par with Verona, Turin, Vicenza, Naples, and Genoa Roberta di Camerino is the only major Italian fashion brand to be based in Venice Founded in 1945, it is renowned for its innovative handbags featuring hardware by
